            <h3>Web browser cookies</h3>
            <p>Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping

              </li>
              <li>
                <i>To personalize user experience</i>

            <h3>How we protect your information</h3>
            <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized
              access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information
              and data stored on our Site.</p>

              13.</p>
